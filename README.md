Flood and Fire Detection with Web Technologies
This web application is a testament to the power of web development for real-time object detection! It utilizes your device's camera and a custom-trained model to identify potential fire and flood hazards in your surroundings.

Key Features:

Real-time Detection: Analyzes the live camera feed for signs of fire and flood, keeping you vigilant.
Custom-built Model: Leverages a model trained specifically for fire and flood detection, built by using powerful web technologies.
Visual Feedback: Highlights detected objects (fire and flood) with bounding boxes and labels for clear identification.
Performance Monitoring: Displays the real-time frames per second (FPS) to gauge processing performance.
How it Works:

User Media Access: The application first requests access to your device's camera (environment mode by default) and retrieves a live video stream.
Model Loading: It then loads a pre-trained model, meticulously crafted using web technologies, to identify fire and flood patterns within the video frames.
Continuous Detection: The application continuously analyzes each frame of the video stream using the custom-built model.
Prediction and Visualization: If fire or flood is detected, the model generates predictions including bounding boxes and class labels (fire/flood) which are then visualized on the live camera feed.
Performance Measurement:The application calculates and displays the real-time frames per second (FPS) to provide insights into processing performance.

Requirements:

A webcam connected to your device.
A basic understanding of web development concepts like machine learning and object detection .
This is a simplified implementation for demonstration purposes. Further development is required for real-world applications, such as integrating with alarm systems or emergency response services.
